# Ispy
This is an extension that uses a device's in built webcam to take pictures. The images are stored via google's storage api but the images can be forwarded using email or cross extension communication.

# Why Ispy
This extension is part of a bigger project that I have in mind. I am thinking to combine this extension with [Key-Logger](https://github.com/sakshamahluwalia/Key-Logger), to allow a laptop/pc owner to track activity on their web browser.
